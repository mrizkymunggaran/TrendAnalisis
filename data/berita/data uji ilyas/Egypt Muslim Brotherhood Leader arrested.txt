REPUBLIKA.CO.ID, CAIRO - The chief justice of Egypt`s Supreme Constitutional Court was sworn in Thursday as the nation`s interim president, taking over hours after the military ousted President Mohammed Mursi and launched a major crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, the group from which Mursi hails. In the highest profile arrest since Mursi`s ouster, security officials said that Mohammed Badie, supreme leader of the Brotherhood, was arrested late on Wednesday in the Mediterranean coastal city of Marsa Matrouh, where he has been staying in a villa owned by a businessman with Brotherhood links. He was flown to Cairo on a military helicopter, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. He, and his powerful deputy, Khairat el-Shater, are wanted for questioning on their role in the killing this week of eight protesters in clashes outside the Brotherhood`s Cairo headquarters. Mursi himself, the Brotherhood veteran who a year ago became Egypt`s first freely elected president, has been held in an unknown location since the generals pushed him out Wednesday. The Brotherhood announced it would boycott the new military-sponsored political process and called on its supporter to restrain themselves and not use violence.
