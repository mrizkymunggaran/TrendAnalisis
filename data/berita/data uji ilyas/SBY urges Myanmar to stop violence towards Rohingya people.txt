According to the report released on Monday and quoted by Aljazeera, entitled All You Can Do is Pray, more than 125,000 ethnic Rohingya have been forcibly displaced since two waves of violence in May and October 2012. Satellite images show almost 5,000 structures on land mostly owned by Muslim Rohingya have been destroyed, says the report. The October attacks, the report states, were co-ordinated by Myanmar government officials, an ethnic Rakhine nationalist party and Buddhist monks. The deadliest attack took place on October 23, in which witnesses say at least 70 Rohingya - including 28 children - were massacred in Mrauk-U township. The UN has described the Rohingya as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world.   "
