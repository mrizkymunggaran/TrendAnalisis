REPUBLIKA.CO.ID, JAKARTA - State Enterprises Minister Dahlan Iskan plans to build three monorail projects in Indonesia. The lanes are Jakarta monorail, Soekarno Hatta airport monorail (in Banten) and Tanjung Perak monorail (in Surabaya). \Jakarta monorail will connect Cibubur-Cawang, East Bekasi-Cawang and Cawang-Kuningan,\" Iskan said on Monday.  Jakarta monorail will be two times bigger than the one in Kuala Lumpur. While the Soekarno Hatta airport monorail is bigger than Changi monorail in Singapura and a station will be built in the airport. For this lane, government expects the cooperation contract would be accomplished between Angkasa Pura 2 with a consortium of state-owned construction companies, such as Adhi Karya, Inka and Len. Iskan expects the monorail construction will start 18 months after the signing of memorandum of understanding. Tanjung Perak monorail in East Java is a monorail project for container service. Once the project completes, Tanjung Perak will be the first port which has monorail in the world.    "
