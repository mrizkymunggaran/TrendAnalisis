REPUBLIKA.CO.ID, SAVAR - Police in Bangladesh took five people into custody in connection with the collapse of a shoddily-constructed building that killed at least 348 people, as rescue workers admitted Saturday that voices of survivors are getting weaker after four days of being pinned under the increasingly unstable rubble. Still, in a boost for the rescuers, 29 survivors were pulled out Saturday, said army spokesman Shahinul Islam. Most of the victims were crushed by massive blocks of concrete and mortar falling on them when the 8-story structure came down on Wednesday morning -- a time many of the garment factories in the building were packed with workers.  It was the worst tragedy to hit Bangladesh`s massive garment industry, and focused attention on the poor working conditions of the employees who toil for 38 USD a month to produce clothing for top international brands. Among those arrested Saturday were two owners of a garment factory, who a Dhaka court ruled can be questioned by police for 12 days without charges being filed. Also detained are two government engineers and the wife of the building owner, who is on the run, in an attempt to force him to surrender. Violent public protests continued sporadically in Dhaka and spread to the southeastern city of Chittagong where several vehicles were set on fire.
