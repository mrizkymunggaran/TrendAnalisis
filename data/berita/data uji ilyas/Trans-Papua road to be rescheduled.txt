REPUBLIKA.CO.ID, JAYAPURA - Trans-papua road construction will be continued after the project halted. Governor of Papua, Lukas Enembe will discuss the subject in a meeting with  President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. \We will reschedule it after I meet the President on April 29,\" he said on Monday.  Trans-Papua road will connect many isolated areas in Papua and West Papua. First, from Pegunungan Bintang to Yahukimo, then stop at Paniai and Timika Nabire. Second, from Jayapura to Sarmi and Waropen towards Nabire. Ministry of Public Works previously allocated 3,6 trillion IDR for the project. The road construction would be among the largest undertaken in Indonesia. The mega project is expected to cut the goods price in Papua and open more access to Papuan to increase their life standard.   "
