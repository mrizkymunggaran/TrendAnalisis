REPUBLIKA.CO.ID, BOGOR - Former Indonesian vice president Jusuf Kalla expressed his concern over the plan of dual fuel price policy. He worried that the policy would be chaotic and asserted that no other country in the world ever implemented such policy.  \If we implements the dual price policy, I`m afaird it will cause chaos everywhere, including in gas stations,\" Kalla, known with his intial, JK, on Saturday. JK also worried about the slow process taken by the government in decision making to cut the fuel subsidy. He stated it would be better if fuel subsidy was allocated to infrastructure development, health care, and education.  \"I am tired talking about fuel policy. It`s been two years and govt still has not made any decision yet. During my term, it took only three days to make such decision,\" JK asserted.  He also suggested the government to avoid being stuck on decision whether to increase or decrease the fuel price. People were waiting for the government`s decision, he said. \"We need a large sum of money, but unfortunately the money goes to the haves,\" he added.   "
